Why we choose the game
Ludo is a superior game to sorry. I mean honestly think about it, squares are just the most basic shape ever to exist
Setup:
Each player chooses a color and takes four tokens of that color.
Place your tokens in your starting area.
Decide the order of play by rolling the dice. The highest roller goes first.
Basic Rules:
Starting the Game:
Players take turns rolling a single die.
To move a token out of the starting area, a player must roll a  1 or a 6. If a 1 or 6 is rolled, the player gets another turn.
Moving Tokens:
Move your tokens according to the number rolled on the die.
If you roll a 6, you get an additional turn.
Tokens move clockwise around the board along the path of their color.
Capturing Tokens:
If a token lands on a space occupied by an opponent's token, the opponent's token is sent back to their starting area.
A token cannot land on a space occupied by another token of the same color.
Safe Zones:
Each color has a safe zone near the home area where tokens cannot be captured by opponents.
Tokens must enter the safe zone by exact count.
Entering Heaven:
Tokens must enter the heaven area by exact count.
The first player to get all four tokens into their heaven area wins the game.
Winning the Game:
The first player to get all four of their tokens into their home area wins the game.
These are the basic rules and goals for the game of Ludo. Enjoy playing!
